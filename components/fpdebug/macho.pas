   * To make scattered loading by the link editor work correctly "local"
   * relocation entries can't be used when the item to be relocated is the value
   * of a symbol plus an offset (where the resulting expresion is outside the
   * block the link editor is moving, a blocks are divided at symbol addresses).
   * In this case. where the item is a symbol value plus offset, the link editor
   * needs to know more than just the section the symbol was defined.  What is
   * needed is the actual value of the symbol without the offset so it can do the
   * relocation correctly based on where the value of the symbol got relocated to
   * not the value of the expression (with the offset added to the symbol value).
   * So for the NeXT 2.0 release no "local" relocation entries are ever used when
   * there is a non-zero offset added to a symbol.  The "external" and "local"
   * relocation entries remain unchanged.
   *
   * The implemention is quite messy given the compatibility with the existing
   * relocation entry format.  The ASSUMPTION is that a section will never be
   * bigger than 2**24 - 1 (0x00ffffff or 16,777,215) bytes.  This assumption
   * allows the r_address (which is really an offset) to fit in 24 bits and high
   * bit of the r_address field in the relocation_info structure to indicate
   * it is really a scattered_relocation_info structure.  Since these are only
   * used in places where "local" relocation entries are used and not where
   * "external" relocation entries are used the r_extern field has been removed.
   *
   * For scattered loading to work on a RISC machine where some of the references
   * are split across two instructions the link editor needs to be assured that
   * each reference has a unique 32 bit reference (that more than one reference is
   * NOT sharing the same high 16 bits for example) so it move each referenced
   * item independent of each other.  Some compilers guarantees this but the
   * compilers don't so scattered loading can be done on those that do guarantee
   * this.
