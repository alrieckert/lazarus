Some suggestions for documentation writers
==========================================
By DoDi <DrDiettrich1@aol.com>

Content
-------

Have a look at the generated (HTML) docs.
FPDoc inserts a lot of information and links automatically. Don't bother with
adding extra links in text and <seealso>.

Add short descriptions to procedure arguments and function results, these are
shown in the copied declaration. The visibility comments can be removed for
arguments or enum elements, so that it will become easier to spot related items.

Add long parameter descriptions if required, don't put these into the procedure
description. This allows for links to this description!

Don't duplicate descriptions, use links to already existing descriptions.

Consider the later reader.
Public items (methods...) are for use by coders, the short description can read like
"Use ... to ..."
Other items can be hit during coding or debugging, the short description should
provide meaningful information in the FPDoc editor or in the popup hints. Avoid
excess decoration, e.g.:
"Returns ..."
instead of
"<var>ThisItem<var> - reads the <link id="Class.FItem">FItem</link> field."

Don't describe the obvious.
Constructors and destructors deserve special descriptions only, when they have
special parameters. Even then short notes on the parameters are sufficient,
because FPDoc inserts the inherited descriptions for empty descriptions.

Don't describe overridden methods again.
FPDoc inserts the inherited description (at least in HTML output).


Style
-----

Write sentences, terminated with a full stop (dot).
Unterminated descriptions should be revised by (native) English speakers.

Everybody can add revision marks.
I use brackets for now, to indicate passages with questionable content:
[?] unclear wording, possibly wrong. Long: [what's this?]
[???] unreadable or definitely wrong description.
[~] somebody else should make this proper and nice English.
[!] Incompatible or wrong implementation, e.g. [Delphi incompatible!]

For lenghty descriptions I use paragraphs like this:
<descr>
  <p>
    ...
  </p><p>
    ...
  </p>
</descr>

Then it's easy to copy a </p><p> line to all places, where paragraph breaks
should occur.


XML Syntax
----------
Copy and run mkhtml.bat in docs\html\, I cannot commit to that directory :-(

Use mkhtml.bat for quick compilation of single unit documentation, and fix the
reported errors before committing. E.g.
> mkthml controls pp
The result is stored in the html\test directory. It's a good idea to delete this
directory before, because FPDoc does not always update existing files properly!
> mkthml grids pas >log.txt
stores the error log in log.txt, which can be loaded into the IDE, to simplify
searching for missing references and tracking of fixed errors.

Common errors result from a mix of plain text with paragraphs, remarks, pre,
code, lists or tables. Then you get "#text" error messages for such dangling text.

"Warning: Target ID of <link> is unknown: ..." often result from protected or
private items, which are not normally part of the RTL and FCL documentation.
Try to link to a public property instead, if one exists.

Unmatched beginning and ending tags are hard to find. It often helps to insert
an dummy tag of the missing or excess type, somewhere in the xml source, run again
and narrow down the exact location by a binary search.


Sync with the source
--------------------
Use updateXML.bat to find removed or missing items. E.g.
> updateXML controls pp
creates controls.upd.xml, containing added or otherwise missing elements.

Check the console output for "... no longer used" messages, and remove these
items from the XML file. Check the source code for only renamed items, and update
only the name field, in order to preserve already existing documentation.

The *.upd.xml file contains added or renamed items. Find a good location where to
insert added elements. New subroutine argument should be added just after the
procedure element, while changed argument names can be updated in place.

Take the chance to compare the entries with the descriptions in the source code.
But be careful with differing descriptions, and check the implementation as well,
before copying possibly outdated comments from the source code over more current docs!
Hereby it can help a lot to rearrange the entries, for easy comparison with the
declarations in the source code.

Multiple editor windows can help in the comparison of source and xml files,
eventual log files or upd files. Obviously misplaced items (arguments!) can be
moved into an dummy xml file, then moved back from there to their proper locations.
Don't search for whole words in the xml files, because this will *not* find the
quoted procedure names etc.!


The following applies in detail to HTML output format.
------------------------------------------------------

Describe properties only once, and link fields, getters and setters to the
property description:
<element name=TClass.FProp link="TClass.Property"/>
<element name=TClass.SetProp link="TClass.Property"/>

Links behave a bit strange, sometimes.
Links to e.g. parameters or result of a function lead to the entire function
description, not to the particular entry, because no such file exists.

Parameters can only have a short description with no paragraphs,
but the <short> Result description can be detailed like a <descr>.

Use links to identical items, this simplifies the document maintenance a lot.
(See TDragObject descendants and TDrag...Event handlers)
<element name=TDerived.Override.Param link="TBase.Method.Param"/>
