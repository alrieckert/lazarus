1. LCL

  Graphics
    State: loading bmp and xpm works for 16/24 depth
           saving is not implemented, so streaming does not work
           Palettes basically implemented in gtk-interface
    Skills: knowledge of LCL, VCL, deep knowledge of interfaces
    Difficulty: high

  Docking (= the combination of forms)
    State: not implemented
    Skills: deep knowledge of LCL, VCL and probably also the interfaces
    Difficulty: high
  
  Frames (= forms as childs)
    State: not implemented
    Skills: deep knowledge of LCL, VCL, interfaces and IDE
    Difficulty: high

  TControl.Font
    State: not implemented. In contrary to the VCL the LCL should use the
           current Theme of the user. So, the Font property should only work,
           if explicitly set
    Skills: knowledge of LCL, gtk, win32
    Difficulty: medium
