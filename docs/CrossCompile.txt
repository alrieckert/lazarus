Hints to cross compile win32 binaries under linux


UNDER CONSTRUCTION


Thanks to Vincent Snijders for the hints.

1. Download the GNU Binary Utility Development Utilities. Some rpms, debs, tgz
packages are outdated. The following works:
  http://jrfonseca.dyndns.org/projects/gnu-win32/documentation/cross/
Download all files into a directory. There is a small bug in xmingw32.mak.
Search for '#$(GCC' and remove the '#'. Then do as root 'make -f xmingw.mak'.
This will download the binutils, the gcc and the mingw32 files and will compile
them. After installation you can etiher extend the PATH variable or link the
following files:

[]$ ln -s /usr/local/xmingw32/bin/mingw32-as /usr/bin/asw
[]$ ln -s /usr/local/xmingw32/bin/mingw32-ld /usr/bin/ldw
[]$ ln -s /usr/local/xmingw32/bin/mingw32-windres /usr/bin/windres
[]$ ln -s /usr/local/xmingw32/bin/mingw32-dlltool /usr/bin/dlltool


2. Download or compile the win32 units (ppw,ow files for rtl, fcl). These files
must be compatible (depending on the compiler probably 1.0.8 as of now).
Install them next to the linux units in /usr/lib/fpc/1.0.x/units.


2.1 Download the win32 units: Currently you can download the win32 snapshots at
ftp://ftp.freepascal.org/pub/fpc/snapshot/v10/win32-i386/
and unzip them into $UsrLib/fpc/$FPCVersion/units/win32. $UsrLib is the place
where fpc is installed. Probably /usr/lib/ or /usr/local/lib.


2.2 Compile the win32 units:
Download the fpc sources, compile them and install them. This makes sure your
compiler is compatible to the source. The same source directory can be used for
win32, because the output files have different names (.ppu <> .ppw, .o <> .ow).
Then compile the win32 units (.ppw, .pw):

[]$ cd compiler; make cycle OS_TARGET=win32; cd ..
[]$ make fcl packages OS_TARGET=win32

Install the units:

[]$ make -C rtl install OS_TARGET=win32
[]$ make -C fcl install OS_TARGET=win32

This will create the correct directory structure, but probably in the wrong
directory. Move the /usr/local/lib/fpc/<version>/i386-win32/units directory to
your fpc install directory. For example if your linux units (e.g. classes.ppu)
is located in /usr/lib/fpc/1.0.8/units/linux/ then do
[]$ rm -rf /usr/lib/fpc/1.0.8/units/win32
[]$ mv /usr/local/lib/fpc/<version>/i386-win32/units /usr/lib/fpc/1.0.8/units/win32


3. Making /etc/fpc.cfg target independent:
Make sure that your /etc/fpc.cfg contains target independent paths:
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/$version/units/$target
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/$version/units/$target/*
-Fu/usr/lib/fpc/$version/units/$target/rtl
You should now be able to cross compile simple pascal programs with
'ppc386 -Twin32 pascalfile.pas'


4. Cross compiling the LCL
4.1 Command line: cd lazarus/lcl; make OS_TARGET=win32
4.2 In the IDE: Set LCL to Clean+Build, set LCL interface to win32 and
    set 'Target OS' to win32. Then 'build lazarus'. The win32 interface is not
    complete enough for the IDE, but a many of the components already work.


5. Cross compiling a project
Set in Run->Compiler Options->Code the Target OS to 'win32' and the in
Paths the 'LCL Widget Type' to win32. That's all. The next time you build, you
will create a win32 executable.
The IDE will rescan for win32 units, so that 'Find declaration' and code
completion features will now work with the win32 rtl instead of the linux rtl.
Of course, when you open another project or reopen this project the IDE will
automatically switch.
