This directory is used for global "package links".

"Package links" are used by the IDE whenever it searches the .lpk file of a
required package. The files should have filenames with the format
<pkgname>-<version>.lpl.
Where <pkgname> is a valid pascal identifier in lowercase and <version> is for
example 1.2.3.4 (four integers divided by point).
Each file should contain a single absolute filename.
