The gtk2 interface for lazarus
==============================

The gtk2 interface for lazarus is a descendent of the gtk interface. It is not
yet complete and does not even compile. For those who want to help us here are
some hints:

1. The gtk2 interface needs the gtk2 bindings 'gtk2forpascal' from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk2forpascal/.
Please download the latest cvs in a directory of your choice. It contains the
package gtk2forlazarus.lpk.

2. Open this package.
The package contains all the needed search paths and compiler options to
compile a 'gtk2 application' in lazarus. A gtk2 application is a program, that
uses the gtk2 libs. Don't confuse this with a 'LCL application using the gtk2
interface'.

3. Open the package <lazarusdir>/lcl/interfaces/gtk2/gtk2interface.lpk.
This package contains all the needed compiler options to compile the gtk2
interface for the LCL.

4. Create a new lazarus application. This project will be used to test the gtk2
interface and to store all configuration steps. Open the project inspector and
add 'GTK2Interface' as required package to the project.
Then open the compiler options and set as widget type 'gtk2'.


When you compile your program, the IDE will automatically compile the
bindings and the gtk2 interface. Because the interface is not complete the
compilation will fail with some errors.
The next step is to fix the compiler errors by adding {$IFDEF GTK2} directives.
