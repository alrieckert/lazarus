Installation tools
==================

1. creating the fpcsrc tgz:

  The script create_fpc_snapshot_tgz.sh makes a cvs export of the
  fpc FIXES_1_0_0 branch and compress it to fpcsrc-1.0.7.tgz.
  
  
2. creating the fpcsrc rpm:

  As root:
  Put the fpcsrc-1.0.7.tgz of step 1. into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/ and
  run 'rpm -ba fpcsrc-1.0.7-1.spec'. This will create the src rpm and the
  rpm for the current system (e.g. redhat 7.3). The src rpm can be used to
  create rpms for any system by building it on the destination system.
  The fpcsrc rpm will simply copy the files into /usr/share/fpcsrc. It does
  not contain any binaries, so all rpms are system independent. The lazarus
  IDE searches the fpc src automatically in /usr/share/fpcsrc and so the user
  does not need to setup this path.
  
  
3. creating the lazarus tgz:

  The script create_lazarus_snapshot_tgz.sh makes a cvs export of lazarus and
  compress it to lazarus-0.8.5.tgz.


4. creating the lazarus rpm:

  As root:
  Put the lazarus-0.8.5.tgz of step 3. into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/ and
  run 'rpm -ba lazarus-0.8.5-1.spec'. This will create the src rpm and the
  rpm for the current system (e.g. redhat 7.3). The src rpm can be used to
  create rpms for any system by building it on the destination system (see 5.).
  The package depends on 'fpc >= 1.0.7' and 'fpcsrc >= 1.0.7'.


5. To create other system specific rpms:
  rpm --rebuild lazarus-0.8.5-1.src.rpm
