Installation tools
==================

This document describes how to create the various packages for lazarus
including freepascal packages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TGZ

Creating the fpcsrc tgz:

  The script create_fpc_snapshot_tgz.sh makes a cvs export of the
  fpc FIXES_1_0_0 branch and compress it to fpcsrc-1.0.7-1.tgz.


Creating the lazarus tgz:

  The script create_lazarus_snapshot_tgz.sh makes a cvs export of lazarus and
  compress it to lazarus-0.8.5.tgz.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RPM:

Creating the fpc rpm:

  As a user of your choice:
  Install the latest fpc package you can get. You will need it to compile the
  compiler itself. Then download the fpc cvs of the FIXES_1_0_0 branch and
  compile the RTL and the compiler with 'make rtl' and 'make compiler'.
  Before you create the rpm, you should define a release tag. Open
  <fpc>/install/fpc.spec and change the Release tag to laz.20030220. The number
  is simply the date, when this README was written. Use the current date.

  As root:
  The fpc and fpcdoc RPMs can be created with 'make rpm'. If you only want to
  create the fpc RPM, then use 'make rpm NODOCS=1'.
  The RPMs are normally created under /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/


Creating the fpcsrc rpm:

  As a user of your choice:
  Create the fpcsrc-1.0.7-1.tgz of 'Creating the fpcsrc tgz' and put it into
  /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/.

  As root:
  Run 'rpm -ba fpcsrc-1.0.7-1.spec'. This will create the src rpm and the rpm
  for the current system (e.g. redhat 7.3).
  The src rpm can be used to create rpms for any system by building it on the
  destination system.
  The fpcsrc rpm will simply copy the files into /usr/share/fpcsrc. It does
  not contain any binaries, so all rpms are system independent. The lazarus
  IDE searches the fpc src automatically in /usr/share/fpcsrc and so the user
  does not need to setup this path.
  
  
Creating the lazarus rpm:

  Important:
  If you have created a new fpc RPM, then you should install it before you
  build the lazarus RPM. Otherwise the compiled lazarus RPM is not compatible
  to the fpc RPM.

  As a user of your choice:
  Create the lazarus-0.8.5.tgz of 'Creating the lazarus tgz' and put it into
  /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/.

  As root:
  Run 'rpm -ba lazarus-0.8.5-1.spec'. This will
  create the src rpm and the rpm for the current system (e.g. redhat 7.3).
  The src rpm can be used to create rpms for any system by building it on the
  destination system (see 5.).
  The package depends on 'fpc >= 1.0.7' and 'fpcsrc >= 1.0.7'.


Creating other system specific rpms:

  rpm --rebuild lazarus-0.8.5-1.src.rpm


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debian:

Creating the debian fpc packages:

  You need the debhelper, tetex-bin, tetex-extra, awk, dvipdfm, latex2html
  packages.
  See install/debian/README.debian for changing /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf.
  Install the latest fpc package you can get. You will need it to compile the
  compiler itself. Then download the fpc cvs of the FIXES_1_0_0 branch and
  compile the RTL and the compiler with 'make rtl' and 'make compiler'.
  The deb packages are created with 'make deb'. This will create a lot of debs
  in /usr/src. The lazarus debs are created by changing the version in
  Makefile.fpc, Makefile and prepending a message to install/debian/changelog.


Creating the debian fpcsrc package:

  You need the fakeroot package.
  Create the fpcsrc-1.0.7.tgz of 'Creating the fpcsrc tgz' and put it into
  tools/install. If you have no permissions for that, just copy the directory
  somewhere (e.g. cp -R <lazarusdir>/tools/install /tmp/fpcsrc).
  Then cd into the tools/install directory and execute the script
  create_fpcsrc_deb.sh. It will create /tmp/fpcsrc_temp/ and will build the
  deb there.
  
  
Creating the debian lazarus package:

  You need the X11 package:
  Create the lazarus-0.8.5.tgz of 'Creating the lazarus tgz' and put it into
  tools/install. If you have no permissions for that, just copy the directory
  somewhere (e.g. cp -R <lazarusdir>/tools/install /tmp/lazarus).
  Then cd into the tools/install directory and execute the script
  create_lazarus_deb.sh. It will create /tmp/lazarus_temp/ and will build the
  deb there.
